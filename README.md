Read this documentation to set up a simple macOS VM in QEMU, accelerated by [KVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-based_Virtual_Machine).

### Getting Started
You'll need a Linux system with `qemu` _`(3.1 or later)`_, `python3`, `pip` and the KVM modules enabled. A Mac is **not** required. Some examples for different distributions:

### Step 1
Run `jumpstart.sh` to download installation media for macOS (internet required). The default installation uses Catalina, but you can choose which version to get by adding either `--high-sierra`, `--mojave`, or `--catalina`. For example:
```
./jumpstart.sh --mojave
```
> Note: You can skip this if you already have `BaseSystem.img` downloaded. If you have `BaseSystem.dmg`, you will need to convert it with the `dmg2img` tool.

## Step 2
Create an empty hard disk using `qemu-img`, changing the name and size to preference:
```
qemu-img create -f qcow2 MyDisk.qcow2 32G
```

and add it to the end of `basic.sh`:
```
    -drive id=SystemDisk,if=none,file=MyDisk.qcow2 \
    -device ide-hd,bus=sata.4,drive=SystemDisk \
```
> Note: If you're running on a headless system (such as on Cloud providers), you will need `-nographic` and `-vnc :0 -k en-us` for VNC support.

Then run `basic.sh` to start the machine and install macOS. Remember to partition in Disk Utility first!

#### Step 2.a (Virtual Machine Manager)
1. If instead of QEMU, you'd like to import the setup into Virt-Manager for further configuration, just run `sudo ./make.sh --add`.
2. After running the above command, add `MyDisk.qcow2` as storage in the properties of the newly added entry for VM.

#### Step 2.b (Headless Systems)
If you're using a cloud-based/headless system, you can use `headless.sh` to set up a quick VNC instance. Settings are defined through variables as seen in the following example. VNC will start on port `5900` by default.
```
HEADLESS=1 MEM=2G CPUS=2 SYSTEM_DISK=MyDisk.qcow2 ./headless.sh
```

## Step 3

You're done!

To fine-tune the system and improve performance, look in the `docs` folder for more information on [adding memory](docs/guide-performance.md), setting up [bridged networking](docs/guide-networking.md), adding [passthrough hardware (for GPUs)](docs/guide-passthrough.md), tweaking [screen resolution](docs/guide-screen-resolution.md), and enabling sound features.
